# Forex-MACD-Stochastic
The jupyter notebook contains code to test the MACD stochastic crossover strategy.  There are two files of currency data, one for the GBP/USD pair and one for the NZD/USD pair, both on the 5 minute timeframe.  If you want to run tests on other currency pairs, you can visit Oanda, Duka Bank, etc. to pull additional data.  By far the best pair I've seen is GBP/USD.  As far as the strategy goes, you can look at the code for the specifics, but essentially the stochastic must cross and then the MACD must also cross within a few candles, and the price must be above the 200 EMA for a buy and below the 200 EMA for a sell.
